        <span class="drop-cap">H</span>ot-air ballooning is a fascinating and
        historic form of aviation that dates back to the late 18th century. The
        first successful manned flight in a hot-air balloon was conducted by the
        Montgolfier brothers, Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne, in 1783 in
        France. They used a balloon made of silk and paper, which was heated by
        a fire burning beneath the open neck of the balloon. This pioneering
        flight marked the beginning of human exploration of the skies and
        captured the imagination of people around the world. Over the years,
        hot-air ballooning evolved from a novel experiment to a popular
        recreational activity and even a competitive sport.

        The basic principle behind hot-air ballooning is relatively simple yet
        ingenious. A hot-air balloon consists of three main components: the
        envelope (the balloon itself), the burner, and the basket (or gondola).
        The envelope is typically made of lightweight, heat-resistant materials
        like nylon or polyester. The burner, fueled by propane, heats the air
        inside the envelope. As the air inside the balloon becomes warmer, it
        expands and becomes less dense than the cooler air outside, creating
        lift. This lift allows the balloon to rise into the sky. To descend, the
        pilot can allow the air inside the envelope to cool or release hot air
        through a vent at the top of the balloon. Steering is achieved by
        ascending or descending to different altitudes where the wind direction
        varies.
